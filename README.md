Moments is a Mac OS X widget to hold your photos on Dashboard. Just drag a photo from a Finder window, your iPhoto Library or a Safari URL and it will scale and keep it. Of course you can change whenever you want, simply hit backspace to remove current photo.

Moments goes a step further. If you want, it can hold several pictures at once, and you can swap them by pressing the spacebar, remove a picture hitting backspace or even start a slideshow with customizable delay.

Moments Widget comes in two flavors: Classic and Modern, both of them with ten different gorgeous Italian wooden frames. You can have as many Moments as you want on your Dashboard, they remember your settings and keep your photos as long as you want them to.

If you love to keep photos of your dears, Moments is what you were searching for. Just bring down Dashboard to see that smile or that precious moment you will never forget. With many frames collections to come, you’ll love Moments.

Minimum system requirements are Mac OS X 10.4 “Tiger” or later and an Internet connection (broadband recommended).
